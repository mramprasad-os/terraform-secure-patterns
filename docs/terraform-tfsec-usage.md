# tfsec Usage Guidelines

## Objective
Integrate tfsec into CI/CD to scan Terraform code for misconfigurations.

## Recommendations
- Run `tfsec` on every pull request.
- Customize rules based on internal policies.
- Monitor security trends across repositories.

## Example
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "tfsec-secure-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}

# tfsec Usage Guidelines

## Objective
Integrate tfsec into CI/CD to scan Terraform code for misconfigurations.

## Recommendations
- Run `tfsec` on every pull request.
- Customize rules based on internal policies.
- Monitor security trends across repositories.

## Example
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
