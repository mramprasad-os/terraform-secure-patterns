Enable infrastructure observability and auditing.

## Recommendations
- Enable CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs.
- Use CloudWatch for metrics and alarms.
- Store logs in a secure S3 bucket.

## Example
```hcl
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "example" {
  name              = "/aws/lambda/example"
  retention_in_days = 30
}
```
